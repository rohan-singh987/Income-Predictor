# Income-Predictor
In today's time, people don't even know their own worth.      

Corporate is all about knowing your worth and getting paid accordingly. But, How can one know the worth of his/her skills?
You can't just estimate your income by only counting your skills or education.                  
There are different features one should count like:
- Whether his/her Age, Sex or Race matters? or Even your native country or marital status is important in evaluating your worth?



### Counting all this stuff, I have built an Income Predictor:
A deep learning model capable of predicting your income based on Age, Sex, Race, Education, Marital-Status, working hours/week, native country, and occupation with an accuracy of almost 85%.
